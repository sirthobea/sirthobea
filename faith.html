    <h1>TRANSPORTATION</h1>
    <p>Faith Academy endeavours to provide school bus service to those students who require this type of service and reside in<br>
        specific catchment areas.  Due to the number of requests that are received each year not every request can be<br>
        accommodated, and therefore a priority list has been developed to outline how the school will honour bus requests.</p>

        <p>·Priority #1 – is to accommodate families who reside more than 1.6 km from the Matheson Campus<br>
           ·Priority #2 – is to accommodate students who are enrolled in Kindergarten to Grades 6 and live beyond the 1.6km <br>
            boundary.<br>
           ·Priority #3 – is to accommodate students who are enrolled in Grades 7-9 and live beyond the 1.6km boundary.<br>
           ·Priority #4 – is to accommodate students who are enrolled in Grades 10-12 and live beyond the 1.6km boundary.<br>
        </p>
    <p>Consideration will be given to students who do not reside close to Metro transit routes.</p>
    <h2>INCLEMENT WEATHER- SEVERE WEATHER AND BUS CANCELLATIONS</h2>
    <p>Sometimes, severe weather causes us to cancel buses. The general rule is that if the temperature combined with the wind<br>
        chill is -45C or colder as registered at The Forks (as posted by Environment Canada at 6:00 a.m.), we cancel buses for<br>
        the whole day but the school usually remains open.  Faith Academy follows the lead of all metro Winnipeg school<br>
        divisions (specifically the Seven Oaks School Division) based on this rule.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Selected radio stations will also announce bussing cancellations. They usually broadcast cancellations every 15 minutes. <br>
        You can also check local radio stations on the Internet.</p>

    <p>If we have not announced or posted a cancellation alert, buses are running.<br>
       Please do not call our school offices or media outlets. Doing so ties up phone lines. Instead, please access the information<br>
       as outlined above.</p>
    <h3>TRANSPORTATION CANCELLATION PROCEDURES</h3>
    <p>In the event of severe weather:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Everyone is asked to listen to the media for announcements regarding bus cancellations and/or school closures</li>
        <li>If transportation is cancelled in the morning, the cancellation will apply for the whole day.</li>
        <li>If it is necessary to close the school early during the day because of severe weather, students will be dismissed early.<br>
            Those students using the bus service will be bused home.</li>
        <li>The decision to close the school will be made by the Superintendent of Faith Academy in consultation with the Director <br>
            of Transportation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Limited busing is available for students.<br>
      Please contact Chris Franczyk, Director of Student Services, ph:204-582-3400 for more information.
